Progress:
1. I am able to build and fix some bugs in the meeting & confirm-transaction system for permanent trading. This was doen through the confirmTransaction() function 
in the TradingSystem.java file and confirmTransaction() function in ItemListManager.ajva file (I understand for the latter function I implemented a huge and clustered 
function but this is the quick-and-dirty way to get it work on my end so I would like to keep it for now and refactor it once I got time)
2. Bugs fixed in ClientUser kept wishlist system
3. Most Recent Trading and Most frequent trading partner functionality are implemented. 
4. Some basic refactoring of the username vs. ClientUser to avoid aliases as per our discussion.
5. Some basic refactoring of the Presenters & Controllers. 
(Note that part 4 and 5 are not in the attached zip file as I still need to debug for the new architecture)

TODOs: 
1. Keep on working on the Time system in the project based on day number (or maybe java.datetime)
2. Finish threshold value controller and presenters.
3. Keep on working on final Refactoring of the general architecture. 

I also noted that when I used another computer with a slightly different settings, the project starts to fail in compilation with some wired bugs, 
but mostly due to filelocations and some directory problem. I would keep on looking into this issues for the final version but I really apologize if 
it could not properly run from your side due to those erros.
